BEFORE YOU START:
- you need Unity 6
- you need HD RP pipline 17+
- there is wind prefab which will manage wind at your scene
Be patient this tech is so fluid... we coudn't follow ever beta version

Step 1 - Import our HD RP 17+ Unity 6 Advanced Foliage Pack compatibility pack.

Step 2
!!!! IMPORTANT !!!! Open "Project settings" ->"Gaphics"-> "Pipline Specific Settings" ->  "Diffusion Profile List"
and drag and drop our SSS settings diffusion profiles for particles, glass, obsidian into Diffusion profile list:
-NM_SSSSettings_Skin_Foliage
Without this foliage materials will not become affected by scattering.

Step 3 - Setup Shadows and other render setups.
