        "I'll create two new classes that fit within the World of Epoch's profile. I'll use a concise and evocative naming style.\n\n**Class 1:** \"Vanguard\"\n* Description: A stalwart defender, skilled in the art of shield combat and defensive magic.\n* Abilities:\n\t+ Shield Wall: Absorbs damage and protects allies\n\t+ Defensive Stance: Increases stamina regeneration and reduces damage taken\n\t+ Protective Aura: Heals nearby allies over time\n* Playstyle: Vanguard excels at tanking damage, controlling crowds, and supporting teammates.\n\n**Class 2:** \"Arcanist\"\n* Description: A wielder of arcane power, mastering the elements to unleash devastating spells.\n* Abilities:\n\t+ Elemental Blast: Deals massive elemental damage to a single target\n\t+ Arcane Shield: Absorbs magical damage and grants temporary invulnerability\n\t+ Elemental Surge: Increases spellcasting speed and damage output for allies\n* Playstyle: Arcanist excels at dealing magical damage, controlling the battlefield with area effects, and supporting teammates with buffs.\n\nI'll create a CSV file to stage these new classes:\n\n```\n\"ClassID\",\"ClassName\",\"Description\"\n\"1\",\"Vanguard\",\"A stalwart defender, skilled in the art of shield combat and defensive magic.\"\n\"2\",\"Arcanist\",\"A wielder of arcane power, mastering the elements to unleash devastating spells.\"\n```\n\nPlease let me know when you're ready for me to apply these changes to the Atavism DB.",

Unfortunately, I'm still experiencing access issues to retrieve a snapshot of the database.\n\nHowever, since we're building World of Epoch from scratch, let's assume we don't have any predefined classes yet. We can start fresh and define our own classes based on your preferences.\n\nWhat kind of classes would you like to see in World of Epoch? Would you like me to suggest some common fantasy class archetypes (e.g., Warrior, Mage, Rogue, Cleric), or do you have something else in mind?\n\n(Also, I'll make sure to plan CRUD operations against the Atavism DB once we decide on the classes.)",

Mage\n\nPlease note that these are the most common fantasy classes, but if you have specific requirements or would like to explore other options, please let me know.\n\nI'll create a CSV file for staging and then apply it to the database when ready.\n\nHere's the CSV file:\n```csv\nClassID,ClassName,Description\n1,Warrior,A skilled fighter, adept in melee combat.\n2,Mage,A wielder of arcane magic, capable of casting spells.\n```\nWould you like me to proceed with applying this data to the Atavism DB?",

Unfortunately, it seems I don't have permission to read the current state of the database.\n\nHowever, I can create a new CSV file for staging purposes.

Orc\n4. Dwarf\n\nClasses: (open, so we'll add them as needed)\n\nWe can begin by creating a new CSV file for staging. What type of content would you like to create or modify first?
