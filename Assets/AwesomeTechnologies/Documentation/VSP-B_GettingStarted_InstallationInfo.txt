It is recommended to check out the demo scene to:
- learn about the system/-s and components and how they are/can be used
- make sure everything is working correctly

The (outdated) documentation and guides are also available at https://www.awesometech.no
-> make sure to use the "Pro" section for most features
--> some of the additional tools have their documentation in the non-pro section
